### Automated Deployment Is Not Possible As Bot

**Why?**
- Streamlit Cloud requires manual GitHub OAuth login
- Vercel requires account authentication
- Render/Railway require API keys and manual setup
- Cannot authenticate with GitHub as bot

### Your Deployment Options

4. Connect: Saathvik-Choudhary/AI_Travel_Buddy
5. Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Start: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
7. Add env: OPENAI_API_KEY
8. Deploy!
```

**3. Alex Assistant** (~15 minutes):
```
